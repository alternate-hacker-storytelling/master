title: Alternate Hacker Storytelling
---

<p>This is my master project for organizing the fictional projects that I work on. This is where I take my regular Hacker Storytelling format, and apply beyond the real world. While I love monitoring the world of APIs, I also enjoy writing about many of my thoughts, rooted in a world that does not exist.</p>
<p>This website acts as a landing page for the alternate hacker storytelling organization, and any projects that I setup within it. While each project will exist in its own repository, you can always access all of them here on this master website, or via the <a href="https://github.com/alternate-hacker-storytelling">Github organization</a>. Here are the projects I am moving forward currently:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://dryden.alternate.hackerstorytelling.com">Dryden</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://the-last-tour.alternate.hackerstorytelling.com">The Last Tour</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://the-invasion.alternate.hackerstorytelling.com">The Invasion</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Much like my real world work, I'm hoping my fictional writing and storytelling will come into focus, allowing me to further explore this side of my brain. I'll be keeping my notes for each project in the private master repository for each project, with regular updates to the public gh-pages branch when I can.</p>
